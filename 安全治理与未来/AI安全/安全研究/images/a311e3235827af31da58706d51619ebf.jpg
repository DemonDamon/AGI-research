<H2>Emma Brunskill</H2>
<p>
I am an associate tenured professor in the Computer Science
Department at Stanford University. My goal is to create AI systems that learn from few samples to robustly make good decisions, 
motivated by our applications to
healthcare and education. My lab is part of the <a href=http://ai.stanford.edu>Stanford AI Lab</a>, the 
<a href=http://statsml.stanford.edu>Stanford Statistical ML group</a>, and
<a href=http://aisafety.stanford.edu/>AI Safety @Stanford</a>. 
I was previously an assistant professor at Carnegie
Mellon University. My work has been honored by 
early faculty career awards (National Science
Foundation, Office of Naval Research, Microsoft Research (1 of 7
worldwide)). My and my amazing lab members' research has received 10 best research paper
nominations and awards (Uncertainty in AI, Decision Analysis Society, Computer Human Interactions, Educational Data Mining x3, Learning Analytics and Knowledge, Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making Symposium x2, Intelligent Tutoring Systems). I am privileged to serve on the International Machine Learning Society (which coordinates ICML) Board, the Khan Academy Research Advisory Board, the Stanford Faculty Women's Forum Steering Committee, and and I previously served on the Women in Machine Learning (WIML) board. I am an associate director for the <a href="https://datascience.stanford.edu/causal">Stanford Causal Science Center.</a> 
<br>
<br>
One of the things I am most proud of is my lab alumni, who have gone on to exciting next steps including as tenure-track and tenured faculty (Carnegie Mellon University,  University of Cambridge, University of California Irvine, University of Hawaii,  University of Massachussets Amherst, and University of Montreal), and research scientist positions (Google, Meta, OpenAI, Amazon). 
<p>
<p> Recently I served as the co-program chair for the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2023 in Hawaii. 
<p>
Prospective PhD student applicants: Thank you for your interest! I generally take on new PhD students every year. Admission decisions are made at the departmental level. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me after you are admitted.  Unfortunately I generally won't be able to talk to prospective students until after admissions decisions have been made.
