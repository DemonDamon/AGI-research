### 📄 学术论文

*   **Title:** Stress-Testing Model Specs Reveals Character Differences among Language Models
    *   **Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07686
    *   **Date:** Oct 9, 2025 (v1 submission)
    *   **Abstract:** The paper presents a systematic methodology for stress-testing AI constitutions and model specifications to identify internal conflicts and insufficient coverage of nuanced scenarios. By generating value tradeoff scenarios, the authors evaluate twelve frontier LLMs and find significant behavioral divergence, which strongly predicts underlying problems in model specifications. The work also reveals clear misalignment cases and false-positive refusals across the models studied.

*   **Title:** Detecting Adversarial Fine-tuning with Auditing Agents
    *   **Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16255
    *   **Date:** Oct 17, 2025 (v1 submission)
    *   **Abstract:** This work studies robust detection mechanisms for adversarial use of fine-tuning APIs, which can bypass safeguards in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors introduce the concept of a fine-tuning auditing agent that can detect harmful fine-tuning prior to model deployment. Evaluating the approach on a diverse set of strong fine-tuning attacks, the auditing agent achieves a 56.2% detection rate at a 1% false positive rate, demonstrating its ability to detect covert attacks that evade safety evaluations.

### 📝 博客文章

*   **Title:** LoRA Without Regret
    *   **Link:** https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/lora/
    *   **Date:** Sep 29, 2025
    *   **Summary:** A technical blog post co-authored by John Schulman and others at Thinking Machines Lab. The post characterizes a "low-regret regime" where Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) performs similarly to Full Fine-Tuning (FullFT) in terms of dataset size and LoRA parameters. The finding suggests that this regime covers most post-training scenarios, enabling the use of efficient fine-tuning in many applications.

### 🎤 访谈与演讲

*   **Title:** John Schulman (OpenAI Cofounder) - Reasoning, RLHF, & Plan for 2027 AGI
    *   **Link:** https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/john-schulman
    *   **Date:** May 15, 2024
    *   **Key Points:**
        *   **AGI Timeline:** Predicted that AGI could be achieved in "two or three years" (i.e., 2026-2027).
        *   **Model Capabilities:** Predicted that in one or two years, models will be able to carry out complex, multi-step tasks like a whole coding project, iterating on high-level instructions.
        *   **Post-training/RLHF:** Discussed how post-training (including RLHF) is a complex operation requiring tacit and organizational knowledge, creating a "moat" for companies like OpenAI.
        *   **Generalization:** Noted that a tiny amount of data (e.g., 30 examples) can generalize well to fix issues like models overstating their capabilities (e.g., claiming they can send an email).
        *   **Web Interaction:** Suggested that models will be able to use human-designed websites using vision, but that AI-specific UXs might be beneficial for certain applications.

### 📄 学术论文

*   **Title:** Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models
    *   **Link:** `http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0870.html`
    *   **Abstract:** "Finetuning language models on a collection of datasets phrased as instructions has been shown to improve model performance and generalization to unseen tasks. In this paper we explore instruction finetuning with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) finetuning on chain-of-thought data. We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation, RealToxicityPrompts). For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PaLM 540B by a large margin (+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks (at time of release), such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models."

### 📄 学术论文

- **Title:** [Which Economic Tasks are Performed with AI? Evidence from Millions of Claude Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04761)
  - **Date:** February 11, 2025
  - **Abstract:** Despite widespread speculation about artificial intelligence's impact on the future of work, we lack systematic empirical evidence about how these systems are actually being used for different tasks. Here, we present a novel framework for measuring AI usage patterns across the economy. We leverage a recent privacy-preserving system to analyze over four million Claude.ai conversations through the lens of tasks and occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET Database. Our analysis reveals that AI usage primarily concentrates in software development and writing tasks, which together account for nearly half of all total usage. However, usage of AI extends more broadly across the economy, with approximately 36% of occupations using AI for at least a quarter of their associated tasks. We also analyze how AI is being used for tasks, finding 57% of usage suggests augmentation of human capabilities (e.g., learning or iterating on an output) while 43% suggests automation (e.g., fulfilling a request with minimal human involvement). While our data and methods face important limitations and only paint a picture of AI usage on a single platform, they provide an automated, granular approach for tracking AI's evolving role in the economy and identifying leading indicators of future impact as these technologies continue to advance.

*   **Title:** Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners
    *   **Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377
    *   **Abstract:** We show that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. MAE simply masks random patches of the input image and reconstructs the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs: (1) an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder only operates on the unmasked patches; (2) a high masking ratio (e.g., 75%). We find that MAE learns very high-quality representations that generalize well to downstream tasks. (Note: A revised version of this paper was published in May 2024, continuing its relevance in the 2024-2025 period.)

    *   **Date:** April 18, 2025
    *   **Summary:** A philosophical exploration of **frame-dependence**, arguing that all knowledge and reality are contingent on the frame (perspective) used to observe them. The post, co-authored by Emmett Shear and Sonnet 3.7, uses examples from biology, physics (relativity), and mathematics to show that there is no privileged "true frame" or absolute knowledge. It connects this to AI by suggesting that frames are created by life for survival and that the recognition of frame-dependence is a "meta-frame" that provides practical wisdom.

    *   **Summary:** Introduces **"organic alignment"** as Softmax's core mission, contrasting it with the prevailing "hierarchical" or "control/steering" approach to AI alignment. Organic alignment is modeled after natural systems like multicellularity, where individual agents (cells, humans, or AIs) learn to align by developing a shared, overarching goal of the collective's flourishing. The post argues that hierarchical alignment fails when the AI becomes too smart, while organic alignment is an adaptive learning process that works better as the agent becomes more capable. Softmax is pursuing a mathematical theory of this process using multi-agent reinforcement learning simulations.

### 📄 学术论文

*   **Title:** Skill Expansion and Composition in Parameter Space
    *   **Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05932
    *   **Abstract:** Humans excel at reusing prior knowledge to address new challenges and developing skills while solving problems. This paradigm becomes increasingly popular in the development of autonomous agents, as it develops systems that can self-evolve in response to new challenges like human beings. However, previous methods suffer from limited training efficiency when expanding new skills and fail to fully leverage prior knowledge to facilitate new task learning. In this paper, we propose Parametric Skill Expansion and Composition (PSEC), a new framework designed to iteratively evolve the agents' capabilities and efficiently address new challenges by maintaining a manageable skill library. This library can progressively integrate skill primitives as plug-and-play Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules in parameter-efficient finetuning, facilitating efficient and flexible skill expansion. This structure also enables the direct skill compositions in parameter space by merging LoRA modules that encode different skills, leveraging shared information across skills to effectively program new skills. Based on this, we propose a context-aware module to dynamically activate different skills to collaboratively handle new tasks. Empowering diverse applications including multi-objective composition, dynamics shift, and continual policy shift, the results on D4RL, DSRL benchmarks, and the DeepMind Control Suite show that PSEC exhibits superior capacity to leverage prior knowledge to efficiently tackle new challenges, as well as expand its skill libraries to evolve the capabilities.

### 📄 学术论文

*   **Title:** **That's not natural: The Impact of Off-Policy Training Data on Probe Performance**
    *   **Authors:** Nathalie Kirch, Samuel Dower, Adrians Skapars, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Dmitrii Krasheninnikov, *et al.* (Margaret Jennings is listed as a co-author in the related EMNLP paper's full author list)
    *   **Link:** `https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17408`
    *   **Date:** November 21, 2025
    *   **Abstract:** Probing is a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs) for concerning behaviors like deception and sycophancy. This paper systematically evaluates how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalization across eight distinct LLM behaviors. The findings suggest that successful generalization from off-policy data is predictive of successful on-policy generalization, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.
