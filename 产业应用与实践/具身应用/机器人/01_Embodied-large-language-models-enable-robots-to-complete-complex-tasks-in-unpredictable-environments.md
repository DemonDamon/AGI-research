## 摘要

This Nature Machine Intelligence paper introduces the Embodied Large-Language-Model-Enabled Robot (ELLMER) framework, which utilizes GPT-4 and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) infrastructure to enable robots to complete long-horizon tasks in unpredictable settings. It focuses on integrating force and visual feedback for complex tasks like coffee making and plate decoration.
