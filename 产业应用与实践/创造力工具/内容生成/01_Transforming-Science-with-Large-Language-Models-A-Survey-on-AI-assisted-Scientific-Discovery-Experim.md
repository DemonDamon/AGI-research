## 摘要

This survey provides an in-depth overview of recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal models, focusing on their application in the scientific research cycle. It covers five aspects: searching for literature, generating research ideas and experimentation, generating text-based and multimodal content (e.g., scientific figures and diagrams), and AI-based automatic peer review. It serves as a reference guide and a catalyst for new AI-based initiatives in "AI4Science".
