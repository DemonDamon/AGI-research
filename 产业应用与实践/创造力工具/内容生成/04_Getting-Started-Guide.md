1. **Visit Your Create Page:** Go to the [Create](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine) page on midjourney.com. This is where your images come to life, and you can see them appear in real-time.
2. **Use the Imagine Bar:** At the top of the page, you'll see the Imagine bar. Here, type what you'd like to see—this is your prompt.   
   [![imagine-prompt-bar.png](ai-leaders-insights/产业应用与实践/创造力工具/内容生成/images/31896e49cfd733b02cd2b003b385139d.jpg)](ai-leaders-insights/产业应用与实践/创造力工具/内容生成/images/31896e49cfd733b02cd2b003b385139d.jpg)
3. **Generate Your Image:** After pressing Enter or the send button if you're using a mobile device, Midjourney creates a set of four images. Watch as your images take form.
4. **Congratulations!** Once it reaches 100%, you're done! You've created your first Midjourney images.

## Using Images in Your Prompts

Did you know that you can also provide Midjourney with images—not just text—to guide your creations?

* [Starting Frame](/hc/en-us/articles/37460773864589) lets you create a video from your image.
* [Image Prompts](/hc/en-us/articles/32040250122381) let you influence content, composition, style, and colors.
* [Style References](/hc/en-us/articles/32180011136653) help you match the look and feel of another image.
* [Omni References](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/36285124473997-Omni-Reference) help you use the same character or object in multiple images.
